title: About Me
---

I’m Adarsh, a student at NIT Rourkela.
I’m interested in programming and problem-solving, and I’m a Linux enthusiast.
This blog is where I write notes, thoughts, and things I find interesting, not limited to tech.
Outside of that, I enjoy music, anime, and reading web novels and manhwa.
